I needed a public location to store some XML data & transforms that I'm going to be using to test behaviour; so here it is.

Addresses & Phone numbers generated by the excellent [generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com) so if those addresses actually exist then it's entirely coincendental.


## XML operations

- invoice-sample.xml + schema_validation(invoice.xsd) -> pass
- invoice-sample.xml + xslt(invoice-emit-xml.xsl) -> invoice-output.xml
- invoice-output.xml + xml2json -> invoice-output.json
- invoice-sample.xml + xml2json -> invoice-sample.json

# JSON Operations

- invoice-sample.json + jolt(invoice-jolt.json) -> invoice-output.json
  - it isn't but it's close
  - Date formatting is "hard" in jolt
  - maths is hard in jolt, and the sundry use of temporary variables annoys me.
